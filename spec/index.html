  <p>RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]] describes a graph-based data model for making claims

    of this specification was published by the

    as [[CCG-RDC-FINAL]].
  </p>

<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>When data scientists discuss canonicalization,
    they do so in the context of achieving a particular set of goals.
    Since the same information may sometimes be expressed in a variety of different ways,
    it often becomes necessary to transform each of these
    different ways into a single, standard representation.
    With a standard representation, the differences between
    two different sets of data can be easily determined,
    a cryptographically-strong hash identifier can be generated for a particular
    set of data,
    and a particular set of data may be digitally-signed for later
    verification.</p>

  <p>In particular, this specification is about normalizing
    <a>RDF datasets</a>, which are collections of graphs. Since
    a directed graph can express the same information in more than one
    way, it requires canonicalization to achieve the aforementioned goals
    and any others that may arise via serendipity.</p>

  <p>Most <a>RDF datasets</a> can be normalized fairly quickly, in terms
    of algorithmic time complexity. However, those that contain nodes that do
    not have globally unique identifiers pose a greater challenge. Normalizing
    these datasets presents the <dfn>graph isomorphism</dfn> problem, a
    problem that is believed to be difficult to solve quickly. More formally,
    it is believed to be an NP-Intermediate problem, that is, neither known to
    be solvable in polynomial time nor NP-complete. Fortunately, existing real
    world data is rarely modeled in a way that manifests this problem and new
    data can be modeled to avoid it. In fact, software systems can detect a
    problematic dataset and may choose to assume it's an attempted denial of
    service attack, rather than a real input, and abort.</p>

  <p>This document outlines an algorithm for generating a canonical
    serialization of an <a>RDF dataset</a> given an <a>RDF dataset</a> as input.
    The algorithm is called the
    <strong>Universal RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm 2015</strong> or
    <a>URDNA2015</a>.</p>

  <section id="intro-uses">
    <h2>Uses of Dataset Canonicalization</h2>
    <p>There are different use cases where graph or dataset canonicalization are important:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determining if one serialization is isomorphic to another.</li>
      <li>Digital signing of graphs (datasets) independent of serialization or format.</li>
      <li>Comparing two graphs (datasets) to find differences.</li>
      <li>Communicating change sets when remotely updating an <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-source">RDF source</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A canonicalization algorithm is necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, to handle many of these use cases. The use of <a>blank nodes</a> in RDF graphs and datasets has a long history and creates inevitable complexities. Blank nodes are used for different purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>when a well known identifier for a node is not known, or the author of a document chooses not to unambiguously name that node,</li>
      <li>when a node is used to stitch together parts of a graph and the nodes themselves are not interesting (e.g., <a data-cite="RDF11-MT#rdf-collections">RDF Collections</a> in [[RDF11-MT]]),</li>
      <li>when someone is trying to create an intentionally difficult graph topology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore,
      RDF semantics dictate that deserializing an RDF document
      results in the creation of unique <a>blank nodes</a>,
      unless it can be determined that on each occasion,
      the <a>blank node</a> identifies the same resource.
      This is due to the fact that <a>blank node identifiers</a>
      are an aspect of a concrete RDF syntax
      and are not intended to be persistent or portable.
      Within the abstract RDF model,
      blank nodes do not have identifiers
      (although some
      <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-store">RDF store</a>
      implementations may use stable identifiers and may choose to make them portable).
      See <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-blank-nodes">Blank Nodes</a>
      in [[!RDF11-CONCEPTS]] for more information.</p>

    <p>RDF does have a provision for allowing blank nodes
      to be published in an externally identifiable way through the use of
      <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-skolem-iri">Skolem IRIs</a>,
      which allow a given RDF store to replace the use of blank nodes
      in a concrete syntax with <a>IRIs</a>,
      which then serve to repeatably identify that blank node within that particular RDF store;
      however, this is not generally useful for talking about the
      same graph in different RDF stores,
      or other concrete representations.
      In any case, a stable <a>blank node identifier</a> defined for one
      RDF store or serialization is arbitrary,
      and typically not relatable to the context within which it is used.</p>

    <p>This specification defines an algorithm for creating stable <a>blank node identifiers</a> repeatably for different serializations possibly using individualized <a>blank node identifiers</a> of the same RDF graph (dataset) by grounding each <a>blank node</a> through the nodes to which it is connected, essentially creating <em>Skolem <a>blank node identifiers</a></em>. As a result, a graph signature can be obtained by hashing a canonical serialization of the resulting <a>normalized dataset</a>, allowing for the isomorphism and digital signing use cases. As blank node identifiers can be stable even with other changes to a graph (dataset), in some cases it is possible to compute the difference between two graphs (datasets), for example if changes are made only to ground triples, or if new blank nodes are introduced which do not create an automorphic confusion with other existing blank nodes. If any information which would change the generated blank node identifier, a resulting diff might indicate a greater set of changes than actually exists.</p>

<section id="canonicalization">
  <h2>Canonicalization</h2>

  <p>Canonicalization is the process of transforming an
    <a>input dataset</a> to a <a>normalized dataset</a>. That
    is, any two <a>input datasets</a> that contain the same
    information, regardless of their arrangement, will be transformed into
    identical <a>normalized dataset</a>. The problem requires directed
    graphs to be deterministically ordered into sets of nodes and edges. This
    is easy to do when all of the nodes have globally-unique identifiers, but
    can be difficult to do when some of the nodes do not. Any nodes without
    globally-unique identifiers must be issued deterministic identifiers.</p>

  <p class="ednote">Strictly speaking, the normalized dataset must be serialized to be stable, as within a dataset, blank node identifiers have no meaning. This specification defines a <a>normalized dataset</a> to include stable identifiers for blank nodes, but practical uses of this will always generate a canonical serialization of such a dataset.</p>

  <p>In time, there may be more than one canonicalization algorithm and,
    therefore, for identification purposes, this algorithm is named the
    "Universal RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm 2015"
    (<abbr title="Universal RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm 2015"><dfn class="export">URDNA2015</dfn></abbr>).</p>

  <p class="ednote">This statement is overly prescriptive and does not include normative language.
    This spec should describe the theoretical basis for graph canonicalization and describe
    behavior using normative statements. The explicit algorithms should follow as an informative appendix.</p>

  <section id="canon-overview" class="informative">
    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>To determine a canonical labeling, <a>URDNA2015</a> considers the
      information connected to each blank node.
      Nodes with unique first degree information can immediately be issued a canonical identifier
      via the <a href="#issue-identifier">Issue Identifier algorithm</a>.
      When a node has non-unique first degree information,
      it is necessary to determine all information that is transitively connected
      to it throughout the entire dataset.

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p><a>URDNA2015</a> canonically labels an <a>RDF dataset</a>.
        In URDNA2015, an RDF dataset <var>D</var>
        is represented as a set of <a>quads</a> of the form `&lt; s, p, o, g >`
        where the graph component `g` is empty if and only if the
        <a>triple</a> `&lt; s, p, o >` is in the <a>default graph</a>.
        This algorithm considers an RDF dataset to be a set of quads.
        Two RDF datasets are considered to be isomorphic (i.e., the same modulo blank nodes),
        if and only if they return the same canonically labeled list of quads
        via <a>URDNA2015</a>.</p>

      <p><a>URDNA2015</a> consists of several sub-algorithms.
        These sub-algorithms are introduced in the following sub-sections.
        First, we give a high level summary of URDNA2015.</p>

      because there was a typo in the spec that has now been implemented
      by many implementations. The design of the algorithm was to use the

      <code>_:a</code> or <code>_:z</code>, similar to how it is used in
      the related hash algorithm, but this text never made it into the spec
      before implementations moved forward. Therefore, the hashes here
      never change, making the loop based on the <code>simple</code>
      flag that calls this algorithm unnecessary; it needs to only run
      once. A future version of this algorithm should correct this mistake.

    <p class="ednote">The 'path' terminology could also be changed to better
      indicate what a path is (a particular deterministic serialization for
      a subgraph/subdataset of nodes without globally-unique identifiers).</p>

    <section id="hash-nd-quads-overview" class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Usually, when trying to determine if two nodes in a graph are
        equivalent, you simply compare their identifiers. However, what if the
        nodes don't have identifiers? Then you must determine if the two nodes
        have equivalent connections to equivalent nodes all throughout the
        whole graph. This is called the <a>graph isomorphism</a> problem. This
        algorithm approaches this problem by considering how one might draw
        a graph on paper. You can test to see if two nodes are equivalent
        by drawing the graph twice. The first time you draw the graph the
        first node is drawn in the center of the page. If you can draw the
        graph a second time such that it looks just like the first, except
        the second node is in the center of the page, then the nodes are
        equivalent. This algorithm essentially defines a deterministic way to
        draw a graph where, if you begin with a particular node, the graph
        will always be drawn the same way. If two graphs are drawn the same way
        with two different nodes, then the nodes are equivalent. A
        <a>hash</a> is used to indicate a particular way that the graph
        has been drawn and can be used to compare nodes.</p>

      <p>This algorithm works in concert with the main canonicalization algorithm
        to produce a unique, deterministic identifier for a particular blank
        node. This <a>hash</a> incorporates all of the information that
        is connected to the blank node as well as how it is connected. It does
        this by creating deterministic paths that emanate out from the blank
        node through any other adjacent blank nodes.</p>

        allows it to be optionally skipped and throw an error if any
        equivalent related hashes were produced that must be permuted
        during step 5.4.4. For practical uses of the algorithm, this step
        should never be encountered and could be turned off, disabling
        canonizing datasets that include a need to run it as a security

  <h2>URGNA2012</h2>
  <p>A previous version of this algorithm has light deployment. For purposes of identification,
    the algorithm is called the
    "Universal RDF Graph Canonicalization Algorithm 2012"
    (<abbr title="Universal RDF Graph Canonicalization Algorithm 2012"><dfn class="export">URGNA2012</dfn></abbr>),
    and differs from the stated algorithm in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-1d-quads" class="sectionRef"></a>, if any blank node was used in the <a>graph name</a>
      position in the <a>quad</a>, then the value was serialized using
      the special <a>blank node identifier</a>, <code>_:g</code>, instead of <code>_:z</code>.</li>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-related-blank-node" class="sectionRef"></a>, value of the <a>predicate</a>
      was not delimited by <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>; there
      were no delimiters.</li>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-nd-quads" class="sectionRef"></a>, the <var>position</var> parameter passed to
      the <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>
      was instead modeled as a <var>direction</var> parameter, where it could have
      the value <code>p</code>, for property, when the related blank node was a
      <a>subject</a> and the value <code>r</code>, for reverse or reference, when
      the related blank node was an <a>object</a>. Since <a>URGNA2012</a> only normalized
      graphs, not datasets, there was no use of the <a>graph name</a> position.</li>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-nd-quads" class="sectionRef"></a>, building the
      <var>hash to related blank nodes map</var> was done as follows:
      <ol>
        <li id="urgna-1">For each <var>quad</var> in <var>quads</var>:
          <ol>
            <li id="urgna-1-1">If the <var>quad</var>'s <a>subject</a> is a <a>blank node</a> that does not

                <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>,
                passing the <a>blank node identifier</a> for

                <var>path identifier issuer</var> as <var>issuer</var>, and

            </li>
            <li id="urgna-1-2">Otherwise, if <var>quad</var>'s <a>object</a> is a <a>blank node</a> that does
              not match <var>identifier</var>, set <var>hash</var> to the result of the
                <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>,
